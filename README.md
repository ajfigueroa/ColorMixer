![Color Mixer Diagram](http://richardfa.com/colormixer-github.png)

### 1). Color Mixer View:
#### The top and bottom of this view are the two colors that are used to blend and create the color in the view in the center.
#### The resulting blended color view will also display the hexadecimal value of the color as well as the name of the color that closest matches it.
#### By tapping on the center view, the top color will update to the color of the center view.

### 2). Top Color Text Field:
#### A hexadecimal text field that takes in a user input and updates the top color to that new value.

### 3). Bottom Color Carousel:
#### A carousel that can be panned or swiped left or right to select the color of the bottom view.
#### This carousel is ordered by color.

### 4). Bottom Color Detail:
#### Details about the color that is selected in the Bottom Color Carousel.
#### Includes the hexadecimal value of the color as well as the name.

### 5). Color Intensity Slider:
#### A slider that determines how much stronger one color should be against the other when creating the blended color.
#### By default, both colors have an equal intensity, however sliding up gives more intensity to the top color and sliding down gives more to the bottom color.

### 6). Features Switch (Beta):
#### A switch that, when turned on, enables an animation effect when a new color is selected in either color views.
